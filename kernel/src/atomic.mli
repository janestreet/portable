(** An atomic (mutable) reference to a value of type ['a].

    Atomic references mode cross both contention and portability, meaning they are always
    uncontended and always portable, regardless of the kind of the ['a] type parameter, or
    the mode of the atomic reference itself.

    - They are always uncontended because mutating an atomic reference happens
      {i atomically} - multiple fibers mutating the same atomic reference simultaneously
      do not cause a data race.

    - They are always portable because all the functions for creating or mutating an
      atomic reference require the ['a] argument to be provided at the portable mode

    For atomic integers, always mutate their value using one of the intrinsic operations
    ([fetch_and_add], [add], [sub], [logand], [logor], [logxor], [incr], or [decr]). For
    atomic references to complex structures, use [update] to atomically update the atomic.
    For example, to atomically add a value to a [Set]:

    {[
      open! Base
      open! Portable

      let atomically_add_to_set (set_atomic : Set.M(Int).t Atomic.t) value =
        Atomic.update set_atomic ~pure_f:(fun set -> Set.add set value)
      ;;
    ]} *)

(** [make v] creates an atomic reference with initial value [v] *)
val make : 'a -> 'a t

(** [make_alone v] creates an atomic reference with initial value [v] which is alone on a
    cache line. It occupies 4-16x the memory of one allocated with [make v].

    The primary purpose of [make_alone] is to prevent performance degradation caused by
    false sharing. When a CPU performs an atomic operation, it temporarily takes ownership
    of the entire cache line containing the atomic reference. If multiple atomic
    references share the same cache line, modifying these disjoint memory regions
    simultaneously becomes impossible, which can create a bottleneck. Hence, as a general
    guideline, if an atomic reference is experiencing contention, assigning it its own
    cache line may improve performance. *)

    set to [replace_with] by this call to [compare_and_set], or [Compare_failed] if the
    current value was not physically equal to [if_phys_equal_to] and hence the atomic
